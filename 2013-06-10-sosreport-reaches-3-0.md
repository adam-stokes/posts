<h2 id=&#34;newrelease&#34;>New release!</h2>
<p>After what seems like the longest development cycle ever we&#39;ve finally released<br />
sosreport 3.0.</p>
<p>Because of the lengthy development cycle I am just going to point you to the<br />
<a href=&#34;https://github.com/sosreport/sosreport/commits/master&#34;>commits</a> to see what<br />
changes were made. The most notable changes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mult-distribution (Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, RHEL)</li>
<li>Increase speed, roughly 2-3s for an average of 61 plugins tested against.</li>
<li>Cloud technologies included (but not limited too):
<ul>
<li>openstack</li>
<li>juju</li>
<li>maas</li>
<li>openshift</li>
<li>azure</li>
<li>cloudforms</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cleaner codebase.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;ve also uploaded sosreport to Debian archive and now just waiting on<br />
ftpmaster approval. Until then keep an eye out on my<br />
<a href=&#34;https://launchpad.net/~debugmonkeys/+archive/sosreport&#34;>ppa</a> for updates.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone involved!</p>
