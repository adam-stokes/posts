The landscape team has created a VMWare image preinstalled with Ubuntu
14.04 LTS and Landscape Dedicated Server 15.01.1. If you wish to try
out Landscape OpenStack Autopilot a MAAS server is still required and
that the hardware requirements are still met per the
[official install documentation](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/cloud/install-ubuntu-openstack).

From the README:

```
Landscape Dedicated Server in a VMWare Image
============================================

This VMWare image contains a simple installation of Landscape Dedicated Server
(LDS) in quickstart mode running on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS ("trusty"). This means
that all needed services are installed on just one VM. It is best suited for
demonstrations and quick trials.

The bundled license is enough to register 10 bare metal machines and 10 virtual
machines.

This is NOT meant for production usage!
```
