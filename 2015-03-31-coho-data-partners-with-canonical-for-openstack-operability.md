[Canonical](http://www.canonical.com/) is pleased to
welcome [Coho Data](http://www.cohodata.com/), developer of the first
flash-tuned scale-out storage architecture for private clouds, as an
Ubuntu Cloud partner and to our [OpenStack Interoperability Lab](http://partners.ubuntu.com/partner-programmes/openstack)
(OIL) program. Coho provides web-scale storage for the cloud
generation; delivering unparalleled performance and simplified
management at public cloud capacity pricing.

As the [OpenStack](http://www.ubuntu.com/cloud/openstack) ecosystem continues to grow rapidly, so does
our [OpenStack Interoperability Lab](http://www.ubuntu.com/cloud/ecosystem/ubuntu-openstack-interoperability-lab). In OIL,
Canonical conducts interoperability testing on 3,000 plus cloud configurations each month, now with
Coho Data storage arrays along with 32 other OIL [partners on Ubuntu OpenStack](http://www.ubuntu.com/cloud/ecosystem).
OIL provides customers with confidence that components of an OpenStack
cloud interoperate well together – making it easier to deploy and
consume cloud resources. Canonical and Coho Data will also work
together to simplify and automate the installation, deployment and
management of OpenStack cloud storage components. Coho Data will
provide[Charms](https://jujucharms.com/) to make it easy to deploy
their storage arrays with OpenStack using Canonical’s[Juju](http://www.ubuntu.com/cloud/tools/juju).
